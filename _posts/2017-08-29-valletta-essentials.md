# Valletta Essentials

![St. Paul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcofromsicily/blog/master/images/stpaul.jpg)

"Valletta Essentials" is my collection of essential links for digital nomads visiting [Valletta](http://www.cityofvalletta.org/).

I advice to dedicate a screen of your smartphone to bookmarks related to Valletta, so you can feel the pulse of the city with a look at your smartphone.

This quick guide for nomad workers was inspired by [Awesome Linux](https://github.com/madbob/awesome-linux-dev).
