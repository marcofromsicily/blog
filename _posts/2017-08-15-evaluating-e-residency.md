### Background

[Estonia e-residency](https://e-resident.gov.ee/) is a service provided by the [Republic of Estonia](https://estonia.ee/) in order to grant access to digital services to anyone in the world.

The e-residency allows e-residents to [setup and remotely manage a company in Estonia](https://e-resident.gov.ee/start-a-company/), to [open and manage a bank account in Finland](https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/a-new-era-for-location-independent-entrepreneurs-has-begun-ece91cbf8876), to digitally sign contracts and to declare estonian taxes online.

The e-residency program [seems to be target](https://e-estonia.com/it-sector/) especially to app developers and cloud providers.

e-residency is not related to citizenship and does not give the right to physically enter or reside in Estonia.



### Pros

* e-residents can benefit digital inclusion by using their cards to login into Estonian state services and into private services like Banks and Insurances.
* e-residents can setup and manage a company online.
* e-residency is NOT a proposal to avoid taxes, so it is legal in your home country.
* there are [treaties for the avoidance of double taxation](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/personal-taxation/treaties-avoidance-double-taxation-concluded-member-states_en) between Estonia and many countries, so e-resident companies should pay taxes only in one country, either Estonia or they home country.
* e-residents companies can sign contracts and make business under the same Estonian law system.
* e-residents can open a bank account and operate un €.
* low bureacracy cost: bank account + business address + accounting cost [around € 100 / month](https://www.leapin.eu/pricing).
* the Estonian state certifies the identity of all e-residents by collecting their fingerprints.
* e-residency grants access to the [eIDAS program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS).
* [authentication APIs](https://eid.eesti.ee/index.php/EID_application_guide) can be used by service providers.


### Cons

* e-residents still have to deal with their own country tax bureaucracy.
* to deal with tax offices from two different countries results in an increase of bureaucracy, even if a company avoids double taxation.
* starting 29.09.2018 Estonia has to accept [Italian digital identity](http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/infrastrutture-architetture/il-regolamento-ue-ndeg-9102014-eidas/tappe-del-regolamento-eidas) and eIDAS compliant digital identities as electronic identification. So for european citizens who alreaady have an eIDAS compliant indentity, the e-resident card will be become unnecessary in 2018.

### AMA

Here is the link to the [e-residency AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/6tun01/we_are_eresidency_and_holvi_ask_us_anything_about/).
