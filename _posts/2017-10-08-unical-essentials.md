# Unical Essentials

![Arcavacata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcofromsicily/blog/master/images/arcavacata.jpg)

"Unical Essentials" is my collection of essential links for digital nomads visiting [Università della Calabria](http://www.unical.it/).

I advice to dedicate a screen of your smartphone to bookmarks related to Rende, so you can feel the pulse of the city with a look at your smartphone.

This quick guide for nomad workers was inspired by [Awesome Linux](https://github.com/madbob/awesome-linux-dev).
